<h1>Evaluation protocol</h1>
<h2>General results</h2>
<p>The single score attributed to each model is non-quantifiable</p>
<p>However, a user can expect the following (assuming an equal weighting of 5)</p>
<p>Any score below 3 is a great score, indicating an accurate, fast and of medium complexity model</p>
<p>A score between 6 and 10 is average</p>
<p>Any score below below 11 is bad and models typically do not meet the specified requirements</p>
